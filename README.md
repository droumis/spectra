spectra of blood, water, and maybe some other fun things

## Blood Data 
...is aggregated by [Scott Prahl](https://omlc.org/spectra/hemoglobin/summary.html), as explained by him below:

Tabulated Molar Extinction Coefficient for Hemoglobin in Water  
These values for the molar extinction coefficient e in [cm-1/(moles/liter)] were compiled by Scott Prahl using data from  
- W. B. Gratzer, Med. Res. Council Labs, Holly Hill, London
- N. Kollias, Wellman Laboratories, Harvard Medical School, Boston  
  
To convert this data to absorbance A, multiply by the molar concentration and the pathlength. For example, if x is the number of grams per liter and a 1 cm cuvette is being used, then the absorbance is given by

```
        (e) [(1/cm)/(moles/liter)] (x) [g/liter] (1) [cm]
  A =  ---------------------------------------------------
                          64,500 [g/mole]
```  
using 64,500 as the gram molecular weight of hemoglobin.  
To convert this data to absorption coefficient in (cm-1), multiply by the molar concentration and 2.303,

       Âµa = (2.303) e (x g/liter)/(64,500 g Hb/mole)
where x is the number of grams per liter. A typical value of x for whole blood is x=150 g Hb/liter.

## Water Data
... is also aggregated by [Scott Prahl](https://omlc.org/spectra/water/abs/index.html) from:
- D. J. Segelstein, "The complex refractive index of water," University of Missouri-Kansas City, (1981).
- S. G. Warren, "Optical constants of ice from the ultraviolet to the microwave," Appl. Opt.,23, 1026-1225, (1984).
